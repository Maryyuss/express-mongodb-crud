# Basic CRUD API with Express.js and MongoDB

This project is a simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** API built using **Express.js** and **MongoDB**, ideal for practice or as a starter backend template.

## Features

- Full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Uses **Express Router** for cleaner route structure
- Uses `.env` to manage private configuration like database URIs and ports
- Nodemon for live-reloading during development
- Custom `npm` scripts:
  - `npm run serve` – runs the app using `node`
  - `npm run dev` – runs the app using `nodemon` for development
